# Maximum digit recognition

Project files for maximum digit Kaggle competition hosted by MAIS 202. Code is in Final_submission as a Python notebook file. Requires uploading Kaggle api key to  import data. Two models are used, VGG16 and a modified VGGnet sourced from a repository referenced in the writeup and in the notebook file. VGG16 was our best implementation, achieving a final submission accuracy of 97.5%.
